# nuxt3-starter-kit "Todo List"

In order to keep track of the progress, I've created this `Todo List` for the `nuxt3-starter-kit` project. For every `Category Block` as well as for every `Packages & Demo Content` you'll find a separate commit. This way you can not only easily see what has been done and what is still left to do, you're also able to "undo" parts of the project, if you don't need or want them.

## Pre-Requisites

- [x] Define `Starter-Kit Package list`
- [x] Create `nuxt3-starter-kit Repository`
- [x] Create `README.md`
